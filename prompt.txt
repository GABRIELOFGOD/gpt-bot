Furthermore, we are looking into referral program, but their are some criterials one must pass to earn referral bonuses. The referral benefits are only available to 20th generation, when my direct referrals are the first generation, my referrals' referrals are the second generation upto 20th generation.
Here are the criterials: I will be using myself as an instance for proper explaination. From my direct referrals which are the first generation, I will be earning 50 precentage their own earning. i.e if my direct referral is earning 2 daily, I will be getting additional one to my balance together with my own normal earnings and this does not by any means affect my referrals. The second generation, the criterials are I must have at least 2 direct referrals myself to earn from my referrals' referrals, and I must have invested at least 100 combined (all of my own personal investments) the third which is the last criterial, my direct referrals (level must have invested 300 combined) to earn 30 precentage from the second generation. Please note that it's my own direct referrals oo. The third generation, I must have at least 3 referrals, I must have invested at least 200 personally and my direct referrals must have invested at least 500 combined before I can earn 20 precentage from the third generation income. Fourth generation, I must have at least 4 direct referrals, I must have invested 200 personally and my direct referrals must have invested 1000 to earn 10 precentage. For level 5, I must have invested at least 300, with 5 direct referrals, and 1000 of total direct referrals investment for a daily income of 10% interest of the 5th generation earnings. The six generation is 6 direct referrals, 300 personal investment 1500 direct referral investment for  dailyreturn of 10 precentage of the level 6 earnings. The seventh generation, I must have at least 7 direct referrals, 500 of personal investment, 1500 of direct referrals' investment combined for  5 precentage of the seventh generation earning. For 8th and 9th generation, I must have 8, 9 referrals respectfully, I must have invested at least 500 personally, my direct referrals must have invested 2000 combined for a 5 precentage of return of this generations earning respectfully. For the 10th generation, I must have invested 500 personally, I must have at least 10 direct referrals, my direct referrals must have invested at least 2500 for me to be earning 5 precentage of the people of level 10 earnings. From level 11 - 15 (11-15th generation), I must have invested at least 1000, I must have at least 10 direct referrals, and my direct referrals must have invested at least 3000 combined for me to be getting 3 precentage from the earnings of this generation. And lastly from 16th generation to 20th generation, I must have invested at least 1500, I must have at least 10 direct referrals and must direct referrals must have invested at least 4000 combined for a 3 precentage earning on the people from this generation. Also note that once a user hits 300% or above of their investment, their balance will be slimfitted to 300% and they won't earn anymore until they tp-up. This is the whole idea, Pleasedo let me know if I am missing anything or you need more clearification on any aspect.



SECOND QUESTION(ANSWERS TO GPT QUESTIONS)
Thank you for the questions, that's so mindful of you. For the first question, there can be delay of course if the system is processing many users. second question, let the details be stored but remember you have my entity tables do let me know if I need to update or adjust anything. The third question, if the direct referral withdraws and the total remaining direct referral investments meets the criterials as well as other criterials, let the user be creadited their due fund. The last question now, you can provide both and explain prons and cons if possible. Because critically thinking, the comapny might decide to update there terms and conditions for any, but for now I don't think anything is changing. Please do let me know incase you have further questions.


ANOTHER PROMPT FOR CHATGPT
There are some issues in this two functions applyEarnings and calculateReferralBonus. You have my user entity, you know there's nothing like totalInvestment, I only have investments relational table, there nothing like directReferrals as well, I only have the referrals relational table so let's rewrite this and also complete the calculateReferralBonus function. Even if you will be returning just the correct version of these two functions, I am ok just correct and complete it.
